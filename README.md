# Tic-Tac-Toe!

## Description
In this game of tic-tac-toe, I explored the use of factory functions and modules. The entire game is contained within two modules (the game and the game board) and factory functions are used to create the player objects.

## Technology Used:
- HTML
- CSS: flex-box, psuedo classes
- Javascript (no global variables!): DOM Manipulation, factory functions, modules

## Notes for the future:
- Implement AI/Computer mode which plays in different difficulties (easy, medium, hard)
- Use the minimax algorithm to create an unbeatable AI opponent
- Organize the use of a monster selection menu as playing only as Grim and Rex can get mundane
- Through closure, variables within a module are unable to accessd from one another unless they are returned
